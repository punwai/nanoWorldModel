# World models for broke people

training LLMs to stream worlds to people.

Basically an MNIST for world models.

There will be two parts to this repository:
1. streamed-mnist: a simple model that can create infinite-length streams of bouncing mnist digits.
2. lil-city: a world model that will allow us to walk around a small town that we've generated.
the data used to train lil-city is synthetically generated with python, where we create a simple
town that we can walk around.
